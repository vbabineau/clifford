## Repo for team *'s  MCG4136 project:
1. ### Transient Response Simulation in Matlab ./matlab
2. ### WeBots T-Intersection project ./clifford
3. ### Unknown ./

## Matlab 2021-03-07 
---
- Fodler for the project was created.
- it was decided that keeping matlab file on a repo could prove useful.
- This project will not see as thourough documentation and logging as ./clifford.


## Clifford 2021-03-07 
--- 
- Project structure was established.
- GitHub will be used to complement/as the project log.
- Incomplete tutorial environment is inplace.
- Basic e-puck robot is in place with a custom controller.
- The more detaied changes can be found on the commit.


### Ideas
**Project Logging**   
Meet with the team.  
Each branch shoud represent a major step (i.e. environment, controller phases...)?  
Pull requests can be use to document who worked on a specific branch and log the ideas.  
Merges into main should be discussed with and approved by the team.  

**Project Plan**  
1. Finish the environment.  
2. Build a robot, establish how the robot operates and which sensors it will use.  
3. Create a base scenario and create a working protocol in the controller.
>This will probably involve the street white lines.  
>Build a model on acceleration, speed and position.  
>3 Car base scenario.
